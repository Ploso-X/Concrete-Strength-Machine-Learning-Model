# Concrete-Strength-Machine-Learning-Model
The purpose of this notebook is to create a model to try and predict the the compressive strength of concrete based on the dataset provided while trying to maintain as small of a mean squared error as possible.

Concrete is one of the most used materials in construction and. For designers, compressive strength is one of the most important engineering properties of concrete.

In this particular dataset the compressive strength is measured in Mpa (Mega-Pascals). All the features except the age are measured in kilograms per cubic metre (kg/m^3). As for the age, it is measured in days.

*Note: If you choose to re-run this notebook, the values observed may not come out as presented.

The function at the end of the notebook is for running the model; feel free and have fun.

Thank you for taking your time to look at my work...:)
